### Account Takeover

_AKA Hyjacking, Stolen Credentials, Account Verification Attacks_

#### Google / USB Study
[Google's worked with UC Berkeley](https://security.googleblog.com/) (and [paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub46437.html)). Two sets of significant results:

##### First, the three types of attacks studdied are listed by their efacacy of full account takeover

1. 25% of credentials obtained via phishing
2. 12% of keylogger victims
3. 7% of victims in thirdparty data breaches

However, phishing also collects phone numbers, geo location, and device profiles. This, combined with historical password enumeration, makes phishing even more successful.

##### Second, the risk signals

- a userâ€™s historical geolocations
- device profiles (User-Agents or machine identifiers)
- unphishable 2fa
